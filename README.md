## Project Overview
An FMCG retailer giant with over 50 supermarkets in the southern region of India. All their 50 stores ran a massive promotion during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 (festive time in India) on their branded products. Now the sales director wants to understand which promotions did well and which did not, so that they can make informed decisions for their next promotional period.
